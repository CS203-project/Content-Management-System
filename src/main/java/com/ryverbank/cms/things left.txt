TASKS TO DO:

# VRINDA:
    - link to user auth, get credentials and save them (done)
    - add approve method (not sure how to do)
    - clean the code (done)
    - add relevant dependencies (done)

#TANISHA:
    - check if correct role and then proceed to do methods, verify 
    - limit actions based on the role for all methods

few unresolved doubts (Vrinda):
- for the Analyst to delete the content, does it need approval form Manager?
- still unsure how to do approved method, see if you can do it.
